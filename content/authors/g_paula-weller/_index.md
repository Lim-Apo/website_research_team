Paula is a doctoral student researching optimization under uncertainty. Currently she is specialized in robust optimization, which is the science of preparing for the worst case when making decisions under uncertain circumstances. Her ongoing research concerns the development and application of robust optimization techniques to emergency response distribution systems, leading to faster and more efficient response plans with a smarter use of available resources.
