abstract: Uncertainty is a highly important aspect of maritime transportation. Unforeseen occurrences related to environmental conditions, poor weather, vessel reliability, or port congestion are frequent and have a non-negligible impact on the total time required for vessels to perform (un)loading operations at ports. We study a special case of maritime transportation named the maritime inventory routing (MIR) problem, in which one must determine the routings of vessels while keeping the inventory levels at ports within the operational limits. In this paper, we propose a robust optimization approach that considers the uncertainty in the total time spent by vessels at the ports. This approach allows the trade-off between the risk of infeasibility (i.e., violating inventory limits at ports) and the increase in operational costs due to the protection against uncertainty events to be assessed. To test the proposed methodology, we used a real-world instance based on the MIR problem faced by a Brazilian petroleum company. In this problem, violating the inventory limits at ports causes considerable financial losses due to consequent interruptions in crude oil production. Our approach supports the decision maker to devise more robust plans in which the risk of violating inventory limits is acceptable. In other words, despite the increase in the operational costs associated with more robust solutions, the approach enables the decision maker to avoid much larger potential costs. For the problem considered, we observed that the probability of infeasibility of the proposed solution may be reduced from 87% to 2%, depending on the level of robustness adopted by the decision maker. However, this increased protection causes an increase of up to 13% in the overall costs.

abstract: "Objectives: By juxtaposing literature in signed language interpreting with\
  \ that of spoken language interpreting, we provide a narrative review to explore\
  \ the complexity of emotion management in interpreter-mediated medical encounters.\
  \ Methods: We conduct literature search through library databases and Google Scholar\
  \ using varied combinations of search terms, including interpreter, emotion, culture,\
  \ and health care. Results: We first examine (a) interpreters' management and performance\
  \ of others' emotions, (b) interpreters' management and performance of their own\
  \ emotions, and (c) impacts of emotion work for healthcare interpreters. Conclusion:\
  \ By problematizing the roles and functions of emotion and emotion work in interpreter-mediated\
  \ medical encounters, we propose a normative model to guide future research and\
  \ practices of interpreters' emotion management in cross-cultural care. Practice\
  \ implications: Quality and equality of care should serve as the guiding principle\
  \ for interpreters' decision-making about their emotions and emotion work. Rather\
  \ than adopting a predetermined practice, interpreters should evaluate and prioritize\
  \ the various clinical, interpersonal, and therapeutic objectives as they consider\
  \ the best practice in managing their own and other speakers' emotions. (PsycINFO\
