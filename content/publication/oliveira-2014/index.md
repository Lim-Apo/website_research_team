abstract: This paper addresses the solution of a two-stage stochastic programming
  model for an investment planning problem applied to the petroleum products supply
  chain. In this context, we present the development of acceleration techniques for
  the stochastic Benders decomposition that aim to strengthen the cuts generated,
  as well as to improve the quality of the solutions obtained during the execution
  of the algorithm. Computational experiments are presented for assessing the efficiency
  of the proposed framework. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm
  with two other acceleration techniques. Results suggest that the proposed approach
  is able to efficiently solve the problem under consideration, achieving better performance
