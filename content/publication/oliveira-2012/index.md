abstract: This paper presents the application of a stochastic Benders decomposition
  algorithm for the problem of supply chain investment planning under uncertainty
  applied to the petroleum byproducts supply chain. The uncertainty considered is
  related with the unknown demand levels for oil products. For this purpose, a model
  was developed based on two-stage stochastic programming. It is proposed two different
  solution methodologies, one based on the classical cutting plane approach presented
  by Van Slyke & Wets (1969), and other, based on a multi cut extension of it, firstly
  introduced by Birge & Louveaux (1988). The methods were evaluated on a real sized
  case study. Preliminary numerical results obtained from computational experiments
  are encouraging.
