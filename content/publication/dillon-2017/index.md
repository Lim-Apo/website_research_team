abstract: Managing inventories in the blood supply chain is a challenging task, mainly
  due to the uncertain nature of the demand for blood units, the perishable nature
  of the blood, and a strong subjective bias towards criteria other than cost minimisation.
  In this paper, we propose a two-stage stochastic programming model for defining
  optimal periodic review policies for red blood cells inventory management that focus
  on minimising operational costs, as well as blood shortage and wastage due to outdating,
  taking into account perishability and demand uncertainty. The adoption of this framework
  allows the consideration of more general stochastic processes to model the demand
  uncertainty than approaches currently available in literature. Moreover, this framework
  renders a model that can be solved efficiently by general purpose off-the-shelf
  optimisation software. To illustrate the potential benefits of adopting the proposed
  model to support the definition of optimal blood inventory control policies, a case
  study is presented considering realistic data representing the daily demand for
  blood, which was generated using the average and standard deviation of the demand
  for eight types of blood. Results suggest meaningful insights concerning practices
  that could lead to improvement in the blood supply chain performance. In particular,
  we observed that it would be possible to revise the current inventory control policies
  by reducing current target levels to diminish wastage and total cost without compromising
  the service level. Finally, the consideration of blood substitutions showed further
  improvement in the performance of the blood inventory management system.
