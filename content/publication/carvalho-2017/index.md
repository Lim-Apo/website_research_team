abstract: The academic literature presents a research-practice gap on the application
  of decision support tools to address tactical planning problems in real-world organisations.
  This paper addresses this gap and extends a previous action research relative to
  an optimisation model applied for tactical capacity planning in an engineer-to-order
  industrial setting. The issues discussed herein raise new insights to better understand
  the practical results that can be achieved through the proposed model. The topics
  presented include the modelling of objectives, the representation of the production
  process and the costing approach, as well as findings regarding managerial decisions
  and the scope of action considered. These insights may inspire ideas to academics
  and practitioners when developing tools for capacity planning problems in similar
  contexts.
