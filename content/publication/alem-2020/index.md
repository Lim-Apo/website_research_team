abstract: This paper presents an empirical assessment of four state-of-the-art risk-averse
  approaches to deal with the capacitated lot-sizing problem under stochastic demand.
  We analyse two mean-risk models based on the semideviation and on the conditional
  value-at-risk risk measures, and alternate first and second-order stochastic dominance
  approaches. The extensive computational experiments based on different instances
  characteristics and on a case-study suggest that CVaR exhibits a good trade-off
  between risk and performance, followed by the semideviation and first-order stochastic
  dominance approach. For all approaches, enforcing risk-aversion helps to reduce
  the cost-standard deviation substantially, which is usually accomplished via increasing
  production rates. Overall, we can say that very risk-averse decision-makers would
  be willing to pay an increased price to have a much less risky solution given by
  CVaR. In less risk-averse settings, though, semideviation and first-order stochastic
  dominance can be appealing alternatives to provide significantly more stable production
  planning costs with a marginal increase of the expected costs.
