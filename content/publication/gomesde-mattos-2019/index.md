abstract: Vector
  control, particularly distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), constitutes
  one of the major pathways to prevent and reduce malaria transmission. ITN distribution
  campaigns face several challenges, such as inadequate funding, budgetary constraints,
  hard-to-reach areas, limited transportation, and market and price volatility. While
  long-term agreements and proper planning can effectively overcome such challenges,
  those options may not be available for all humanitarian organizations and governments.
  To gain a better understanding of such tradeoffs we develop a robust optimization
  model that minimize ITN distribution costs while taking into consideration protection
  against financial, market and logistical uncertainties. The simultaneous account
  of such uncertainties is rarely seen on the humanitarian supply chain design literature.
  The proposed robust model explores data-driven adaptive uncertainty sets that capture
  the dependence structure among procurement and distribution costs, leading to plausible
  uncertain scenarios. In addition, we develop a hierarchical optimization approach
  to ease the burden of setting a specific robustness level for each constraint, when
  uncertainties are related to the independent terms. We study a United Nations Children's
  Fund ITN distribution campaign in Ivory Coast, observing that (1) total costs increase
  with campaign robustness, as expected, and (2) campaign robustness comprises of
  improved supply chain flexibility, which might minimize efforts if it becomes necessary
  to adjust procurement and transportation plans when uncertainty arises. In addition,
  assessing robust solutions through Monte Carlo simulations against several realizations
  of uncertain parameter values indicates that, as desired, robust plan feasibility
  increases with the specified level of conservatism.
