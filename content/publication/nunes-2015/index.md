abstract: The use of fuels with low environmental impact has been recently highlighted
  in the media. In this context, the use of hydrogen as a fuel has been considered
  an alternative with significant potential to integrate a more sustainable energy
  matrix. However, there is still no appropriate infrastructure available for its
  commercialization. This study proposes a methodology for designing a hydrogen supply
  chain while considering the inherent uncertainty associated with the demand for
  this fuel in the future. To represent the problem and evaluate investment alternatives
  for the logistic infrastructure, an optimization model is proposed based on two-stage
  stochastic mixed-integer programming. To obtain solutions from the proposed model,
  the sample average approximation (SAA) method is used to obtain statistically certified
  solutions from a reduced number of scenarios. The proposed methodology was applied
  to the design of Great Britain's liquid hydrogen supply chain using real data. The
  proposed framework was able to provide solutions with optimality gaps estimated
  to be below 1% within an acceptable computational time, demonstrating the adequacy
  of the developed methodology.
