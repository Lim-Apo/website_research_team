abstract: We present a scenario decomposition framework based on Lagrangean decomposition
  for the multi-product, multi-period, supply investment planning problem considering
  network design and discrete capacity expansion under demand uncertainty. We also
  consider a risk measure that allows to reduce the probability of incurring in high
  costs while preserving the decomposable structure of the problem. To solve the resulting
  large-scale two-stage mixed-integer stochastic linear programming problem we propose
  a novel Lagrangean decomposition scheme, and compare different formulations for
  the non-anticipativity conditions. In addition, we present a new hybrid algorithm
  for updating the Lagrangean multiplier set based on the combination of cutting-plane,
  subgradient and trust-region strategies. Numerical results suggest that different
  formulations of the non-anticipativity conditions have a significant impact on the
  performance of the algorithm. Moreover, we observe that the proposed hybrid approach
  has superior performance in terms of faster computational times when compared with
