abstract: Oil refining is one of the most complex activities in the chemical industry
  due to its nonlinear nature, which ruins the convexity properties and prevents any
  guarantees of the global optimality of solutions obtained by local nonlinear programming
  (NLP) algorithms. Moreover, using global optimization algorithms is often not feasible
  because they typically require large computational efforts. This paper proposes
  the use of convex relaxations based on McCormick envelopes for the Refinery Operations
  Planning Problem (ROPP) that can be used to generate both initial solutions for
  the ROPP and to estimate optimality gaps for the solutions obtained. The results
  obtained using data from a real-world refinery suggest that the proposed approach
  can provide reasonably good solutions for the ROPP, even for cases in which there
  was no solution available using traditional local NLP algorithms. Furthermore, compared
  with a global optimization solver, the proposed heuristic is capable of obtaining
  better solutions in less computational time.
