abstract: The crude oil offloading and supply problem (COSP) is a type of operation
  maritime inventory routing (MIR) problem encountered by petroleum companies. In
  COSP, the company not only is responsible for the ship scheduling to carry the crude
  oil from production sites to discharge ports but also must maintain inventory levels
  at both ports (production and consumption) between safety operational bounds to
  avoid disruptions in its crude oil production and/or refining processes. We show
  how to improve significantly the decision-making process in a Brazilian petroleum
  company using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to represent COSP.
  Comparison tests with a current ship-scheduling method adopted in the company indicated
  that the use of the MILP model increased the transportation efficiency and reduced
  costs by 20% on average. In addition to the quantitative gains, the use of a MILP
  model to solve COSP has succeeded when encountering real-life events, such as variation
  in production or consumption rates, berth unavailability, and changes in the storage
  capacities at ports.
